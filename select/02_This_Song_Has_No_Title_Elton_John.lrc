[00:05.36] Tune me into the wild side of life
[00:09.62] I'm an innocent young child, sharp as a knife
[00:13.99] Take me to the Garretts where the artists have died
[00:18.83] Show me the courtrooms where the judges have lied
[00:43.33] 
[00:27.05] Let me drink deeply from the water and the wine
[00:31.44] Light coloured candles in dark dreary mines
[00:35.99] Look in the mirror and stare at myself
[00:39.93] And wonder if that's really me on the shelf
[01:01.43] 
[00:48.32] And each day I learn just a little bit more
[00:52.84] I don't know why but I do know what for
[00:57.20] If we're all going somewhere, let's get there soon
[01:01.18] Oh this song's got no title, just words and a tune
[01:26.18] 
[01:13.28] Take me down alleys where the murders are done
[01:16.92] In a vast, high powered rocket to the core of the sun
[01:22.03] Want to read books in the studies of men
[01:26.32] Born on the breeze and die on the wind
[01:45.32] 
[01:34.11] If I was an artist who paints with his eyes
[01:38.69] I'd study my subject and silently cry
[01:42.91] Cry for the darkness to come down on me
[01:47.13] For confusion to carry on turning the wheel
[02:08.63] 
[01:55.58] And each day I learn just a little bit more
[02:00.05] I don't know why but I do know what for
[02:04.62] If we're all going somewhere, let's get there soon
[02:08.12] Oh this song's got no title, just words and a tune
