Oh she pretty pretty, she pretty with it
I get it, so pretty
My Molly is in the city
Come on!
She's in the city and she too pretty
I get it, too busy, busy 'cause she's living in the city
Come on!
She's in the city, she's in the city
No .my pretty, my pretty
My Molly in the city
Come on! huh
I will hold you in my arms
I will hold you in my arms tonight

Again again and again
For the first time
And again for the first time
Again, again
Oh she pretty pretty, she pretty with it
I get it, so pretty
My Molly is in the city
Oh come on!
She's in the city and she too pretty
I get it, it's busy,
Busy 'cause she's living in the city
Come on!
